<br><br>
Currently I help run the <a href="https://abcdstudy.org">ABCD Study</a> in Vermont, the largest and longest longitudinal study of adolescent brain development in the U.S. Initially I ran subjects, scheduled visits, and managed our part-time staff. Now, after a brief dive into the world of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/">the Tidyverse</a> (thank you professor Weaver!), I am the resident data wrangler, amateur Shiny app developer, and researcher in training.
<br><br>
Some kind words related to R wizardry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dude you are soooo good at this. Wtf.&rdquo; -Amanda, Neuroscience PhD candidate <br><br>
&ldquo;Yeah, he practically coded my whole master&rsquo;s thesis.&rdquo; -Zoe, Master&rsquo;s student in Pharmacology<br><br>
&ldquo;You really like this programming shit don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; -Alexi, ABCD PI<br><br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prior I worked in a mental health and addiction treatment center, a Title I elementary school in New Hampshire, and an 8-week overnight summer camp in Maine.
<br><br>
Books, people, playing outside, and learning bring me joy.
<br><br>
I am a California native turned New England enthusiast.
<br><br>
I once walked across Spain and <a href="https://philintheblank.me/tags/camino-de-santiago/">wrote about it</a>.

<p>&lsquo;Phil in the Blank&rsquo; is my ongoing attempt at <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/figuring/">making sense</a> of the world.

<h2 id="some-self-indulgence">some self-indulgence</h2>

<p>I spent most of my childhood immersed in the digital landscape of video games. This meant that I didn’t spend much time thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was a gamer.
<br><br>
In my last year of high school, the enthusiasm of a cheery psychology teacher lead me to develop an interest in the inner landscapes of the human mind. If I learned how the mind worked, I thought, then I would discover what it was that I actually wanted to be when I grew up.
<br><br>
Of course, learning about the mind as a scientific subject didn&rsquo;t provide answers to my growing existential angst. If anything, it made things worse. Having no clear path or compass to guide me, I did what any lost person would do and threw myself further into the only arena I felt at home: League of Legends. I became one of the top 0.1% of players in the game, though the glory was temporary and short-lived. While I felt like a winner on Summoner’s Rift, life was a game I had yet dared to approach. It was a game I was ultimately losing in.
<br><br>
I quit during the summer of my 4th year of college and enrolled in a 6-week study that taught me how to meditate, among other things. Meditation changed the way I perceived myself and the world. It helped me come to the fact that I wasn’t fully subject to the natural whims of my environment and emotions. I could choose what part of my experience to attend to, which was key in steering myself away from the allure of my pixelated past, and into a more meaningful future. For the rest of the year I threw myself into popular psychology books like <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow">Flow</a> and <a href="http://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1259">The Brain That Changes Itself</a>. I began searching for something called happiness.
<br><br>
After graduating from college I worked at an intensive outpatient center focused on treating drug addiction and mental health problems. Mainly I dealt with the insurance side of things - which is to say the worst side of things - but I also had the opportunity to interact with and listen to the stories of our patients on a daily basis. They taught me that the road to recovery was arduous and long, but never out of reach. Empathy, mindfulness and compassion were essential. The patients and the therapists on my team were great teachers.
<br><br>
Despite landing a full-time job right out of college and living in the beautful Santa Barbara, I was constantly burdened by the weight of an unidentifiable existential dread. I had spent most of my life learning how to excel in school and video games, a place where the expectations were predefined and the objectives clear. This was no longer the case, and I was suffering the consequences: aimlessness, despondence, a lack of meaning. Eventually I left and moved back in with my parents and began a six month soul-search.
<br><br>
I then took a year-long position as an AmeriCorps member with the educational nonprofit City Year in Manchester, New Hampshire. I worked as a student mentor in a 4th and 5th grade Title I classroom lead by a young and passionate teacher. Many of our students were performaing several grade levels below state standards. I was there to change that. As the year progressed, I became curious about the circumstances surrounding my students. Most of them lived in a state of constant stress and disarray, factors that severely degraded their academic performance and any prospect of a better future. After all, how could they focus on learning how to read and write when their words had little impact in their circumstances outside of school?
<br><br>
Yet school was all they had. It was the safe-haven in which they could play and be with friends, express themselves and their grand ideas, experiment and be full-blooded kids. I couldn’t change much about their circumstances, but for 6 hours a day, they at least had each other and me. I brought in fresh fruit for them; I helped them build and program robots; I taught them how to meditate. And they taught me how to love.
<br><br>
Two weeks before City Year ended, I was accepted into a graduate program for Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at Boston University, but both the price tag and the career prospects made me reconsider. Ultimately it didn’t feel like a good fit for me, so I decided not to take the offer. With no clear plan in sight and an apartment lease coming to its end, I then took a job as a camp counselor in Maine.
<br><br>
In many ways Gem, the camp director, was right when he said, “This will be the hardest job you will ever love!” At all hours of the clock, I was responsible for the joy and well-being of my assigned campers, as well as that of others. Solitude came only in stolen moments. Every free thought and action was supposed to be dedicated toward creating a $14,000 summer camp extravaganza. Regardless, I was often able to find the necessary space and time to apply for a few post-camp jobs. I heard back from only one and was later rejected by them.
<br><br>
A few days later, I bought a one-way ticket to Europe to walk the <a href="https://philintheblank.me/tags/camino-de-santiago/">Camino de Santiago</a>, a month-long pilgrimage in Northern Spain. I had promised myself in New Hampshire that I’d walk it at some later point in my life, but the circumstances could be no more perfect. With no job secured and a lack of formal obligations, I was free to trot across foreign lands. I was searching for direction again.
<br><br>
The Camino is a magical place. It challenged me to grow and feel emotions I had only glimpsed before - awe, gratitude, joy, interconnection with others and the earth, love beyond bounds. In part this was due to a girl I met. We met on the second day of my journey. She was a medical student from Belgium, walking the Camino also in search of clarity. We exchanged stories and taught each other about life over the next 14 days. Then she was gone. She had to go home to resume her medical studies. I continued onward.
<br><br>
I made more friends along the way, but mostly I was accompanied only by the echoes of solitary footsteps and the beautiful vistas of the Meseta and Galacia. I often thought about what life would be like back home. Career-wise I still wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I knew I enjoyed the teaching, storytelling, and showing people the beauty of the world. I also remembered how fascinated I was by psychology and the brain before I was tossed into the post-college world.
<br><br>
Upon arriving in Santiago de Compostela, the official end destination of the Camino, my sense of self slipped away. I felt a profound sense of openness and connection, a lightness of being. For what may have been the first time in my life, it didn’t matter who I was, what I was doing, or how the future would unfold. I felt free.
<br><br>
I stayed a few extra days in the city before finishing the last leg of my journey. I said my goodbyes to the many walkers and friends I had made at the start of my Camino, and then I was off to Belgium. I had to go see about a girl.
<br><br>
Coming home was difficult. Nothing had changed, yet I felt completely different, displaced. It was hard to for family and friends to relate. I had trouble sleeping, and life had lost its color. My mind and body yearned for foreign roads.
<br><br>
I mulled around for weeks, and then finally decided to write about the experience. It gave me a sense of purpose, a reason to wake up and move forward. At the same time, I began searching for jobs. I applied to a couple of research assistant positions related to neuroscience and psychology, and started the long process of enabling myself to teach English abroad.
<br><br>
The Hungarian school I interviewed with offered me a position. Physical exams and logistics had been taken care of. I finished writing my story. Nothing was holding me back. But some days later, I received a request to interview with a group of researchers in Vermont. My mind was already set on moving to Hungary, but I decided to interview anyways. As I learned more about the team and the research, I realized awesome the project was, and how much I liked the people working on it. I didn’t expect to be offered the position, but there it was sitting in my inbox one week later.
<br><br>
It was a tough decision to make: to continue exploring the world, or to hunker down and build a &ldquo;career&rdquo;. Each day my mind settled on something different. One morning I’d feel ecstatic about the prospect of learning a new language, of living and teaching in a foreign country. The next my excitement swayed toward more practical ambitions on the homefront. I eventually settled on Vermont, reasoning that 1) it would still be a new adventure in many ways, 2) if I was truly searching for a challenge, then I would choose to grow some roots instead of continuing to fly, and 3) if I didn’t like it, I could always go back to teaching abroad.
<br><br>
The decision was made. I packed my life into three bags, just as I had for New Hampshire a year prior, and moved to Vermont.
<br><br>
Living in Vermont has turned out to be much lovelier than I had anticipated. We have seasons, for one, unlike California. From the color and radiance of the New England leaves to the anticipation of a winter turned Spring, the seasons remind me of the everchanging, cyclical nature of life. So until life&rsquo;s currents takes me elsewhere, I am happy to call the green mountain state my home.</p>
