				<p>This past Sunday, I tried magic mushrooms for the first time. It wasn’t much – around a gram or so, which is a bit less than what <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2006/griffithspsilocybin.pdf">this paper</a> suggests for someone of my body weight – but it was enough to dig up some insights about myself and the nature of the mind.</p>

<p><center>…</center></p>

<p>At the beginning there was nothing. I had just eaten the mushroom –  it felt like eating dried mango slices, though without any of the succulence and sweetness – and was sitting on a floor cushion in my friend’s apartment, meditating and waiting to be flooded by the usual perceptual disturbances – visual distortions, heightened bodily sensations, dissolution of the self, the initial nausea that normally follows its raw ingestion.</p>

<p>An hour or so passes, and aside from the buzz of anticipation, everything felt normal. “Nothing’s happening,” I tell my friend. She reassures me that everyone’s body is different and that it may take longer for mine to react, especially since I had just eaten a burrito.
An hour passed and nothing happened.</p>

<p>I wondered if I had been given a defective mushroom, or if I simply needed a higher dose to feel the effects. Disappointed and somewhat relieved, I asked my friend to take me home.</p>

<p>Some moments after walking into my bedroom, it hit me. Something was gradually overcoming my mind.</p>

<p>Two worlds began to emerge. The first was one in which everything was happening to me, to the “I” I identified myself with in conversation and daily life, to what I believe Buddhists would call the ego. In this world we are the center of the universe.</p>

<p>In the second world the ego doesn’t exist. Who “I” am, who we are, becomes irrelevant and meaningless. Everything happening just is. There was only consciousness and the openness of immediate experience. We are no longer separate from the universe; we become an indistinguishable part of it.</p>

<p>I was walking between the two landscapes. I cued one of my favorite songs, Blackbird by Tash Sultana, and was overcome by a gentle weightlessness, a calming respite from the mental clutter and noisy digressions that frequently accompany my days. It was as if a thin veil were being lifted from my immediate conscious experience, and the residual effect was one of growing clarity and freedom. The boundary between myself, Blackbird, and the world was dissolving. I felt able to move into and out of the rhythms and melodies of the music, as if the song itself were an open ocean one can freely choose to enter.</p>

<p>Though I wasn’t entirely removed from normal reality. I was still highly functional, even more so perhaps. Free from all my usual neuroses and thoughts of the future, what naturally followed was a boundless sense of joy, beauty, and connection.</p>

<p><center>…</center></p>

<p>An hour later, I went on a walk down by the lake. Things really did seem more beautiful, despite the overcast skies. The trees and plants glowed brighter than usual, and I felt especially confident and unself-conscious while looking and smiling at various strangers. It felt natural to do so. And when they smiled back, I cherished it as if it were the last smile in the world.</p>

<p>Later I ran into three young people trying and failing to climb one of the carved-out stones at the park. I couldn’t help but laugh at the pure innocence and playfulness of the situation. One of them was on the ground with her legs raised in the air, wobbling and unsteady like those of an overused stool, serving as a base for the others. My laughter came out full and abruptly, free from any hesitation or awareness of social decency. I surprised even myself, though it was short-lived: without much effort I quickly fell back into the absurdity of the moment. The three then looked at me, smiled, and laughed along.</p>

<p>Walking back home, the effects of the psilocybin began to wear off. The vibrancy of my surroundings faded back to their usual hues, though my uplift in mood was still present. I knew I hadn’t taken enough to experience complete ego dissolution or any sort of astronomical mind-bending, but there was a distinct qualitative difference in how I viewed the world, one I hoped would have some permanent bearings. Already the future was returning, but for that I was grateful too. Any sense of struggling for the unreachable had already slipped away, like snow melting on alpine in Spring.</p>

<p><center>…</center></p>

<p>I am now thinking of David Foster Wallace’s timeless commencement speech. Two young fish are swimming along when they happen to encounter an older fish swimming the other way. The older fish says to them, “Morning boys, how’s the water?” The younger fish continue swimming, then turn to each other and say, “What the hell is water?”</p>

<p>What the younger fish are unaware of is the nature of the place in which they have lived for their entire lives. They lack any knowledge of its geography, currents and contours, which is fine if you’re a fish. But for us, it’s direly consequential to be unaware of the water we are swimming in.</p>

<p>For the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been struggling with indecisiveness. It was unclear to me whether or not I should continue taking classes in order to apply to UVM’s M.S. program in Complex Systems and Data Science, pivot into a full-time online web development course, or do something completely different. Meditation helped me recognize that something was bothering me on a fundamental level, but I couldn’t get a good grip on what it was. All I knew was that I felt deeply dissatisfied and unfulfilled for most of my days. I was in a constant state of worry and uncertainty, and I couldn’t focus. Reading, playing outside, and even spending time with friends was no longer enjoyable. If I wasn’t doing something that contributed or related to figuring out my career, then it didn’t feel worth doing at all.</p>

<p>This is clearly a destructive mindset to be in, yet it was difficult to think and act in any other way. The alternatives felt faint and out of reach. I was mired and blinded by the slog of my own sorrows, and I was unable to see that the lifeline was hanging right in front of me.</p>

<p><center>…</center></p>

<p>After finishing the fish story, Wallace states that “the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.” The thing that seems most obvious of all is what is right in front of us; how we see and move about in the world, how can this be any different from what it is, from how we perceive it to be? Changing our perspectives and attitudes isn’t easy, but it isn’t impossible either. Things can be different, if only we attempt to look and pay attention to the narratives and dramas that dictate our lives.</p>

<p>It’s been five days now since my modest trip, and I can honestly say I’m in a better place. The current psychedelic research finds that there can be lasting positive effects on one’s personality after a trip, specifically on the dimension of openness. For me, joy and playfulness seem to come more easily; I feel alert, alive, and am burning with creative energy (I just want to learn and make things, like this essay!); things seem light, open, and I take things less seriously; and I’ve been thinking less about the future and am more invested in the present.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a mushroom trip to glean these insights, but I’d be lying if I said that psilocybin didn’t play a role in redefining my convictions and revitalizing my sensibilities. I’m convinced of its therapeutic benefits, given that one uses them intentionally and has a good set and setting.</p>

<p>Part of happiness – if not all of it – is about being present enough to recognize what is already in front of you, choosing how you behave and react, and allowing yourself to step through the open door of the world when it presents itself. Any compound, practice, or experience that removes you from your default setting has the potential to help you see it. But the secret is that the door is always there, open, available and ready to enter at anytime.</p>
